# Filterable List

### This is a very basic vanilla Js filterable list. 
The purpose is to only show the knowledge of filtering out list items when letters match or 
do not match a search query parameter, using only JavaScript and Materialize CSS.

As you type in letters of a name other names that don't match the search criteria will be filtered
out and only display the ones that are a match.
